This program is meant to build an employee ID for a imaginary company called, "Jeff Co.". The program will ask the user a series of quesetions about the new employee and save the given information
to the employee class. You can use this program to build multiple ID's for different people with their own unique information. 

The eventual goal of this program is to be integrated into a sql database and use the information given to track employee data in the company.
